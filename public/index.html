      content="Good News Nigeria, powered by one of Nigeria’s leading PR and Integrated Marketing Consultancies, Chain Reactions Nigeria, is an intentional initiative to help chronicle positive stories about the world’s most populous black nation and her people. While other news platforms may have chosen to report the good, the bad and the ugly about the nation and her people, Good News Nigeria is wholly dedicated to report positive news only.  It also showcases Nigerians at home and in the Diaspora doing exploits and affecting humanity positively. "

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
