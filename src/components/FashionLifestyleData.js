           <strong>Lisa Folawiyo trained as a lawyer before catching the fashion bug. She had no formal training but founded her line, Jewel by Lisa (now Lisa Folawiyo), in 2005. </strong>  <br /> <br />
            Her collections are exclusively crafted from Ankara textiles, vibrant wax-resistant dyed fabrics characteristic of West Africa. “Our mothers, grandmothers, and probably great-grandmothers have worn this fabric,” Folawiyo told the BBC in an interview. <br /> <br />

            Her garments are embellished with beads, sequins, and crystals, all sewn by hand in local workshops in Nigeria. <br /> <br />

            She has since become celebrated for fusing traditional West African fabrics with modern tailoring and beaded embellishments. Since 2005, Folawiyo has spearheaded the movement of Nigerian designers achieving international recognition for their work.
            <br /> <br />
            She has a knack for elevating traditional African prints above the status quo, making them relevant for a global audience. She has showrooms in both Nigeria and New York. Her collections are stocked in the UK, the US, South Africa, and Nigeria.
            <br /> <br />
            In 2012, Folawiyo won the African Fashion Awards, nominated alongside Maki Oh and Kofi Ansah, two more prolific designers from the Nigerian fashion scene. Championed by Vogue Italia, Folawiyo has also partnered with L’Oréal and done a trunk show on Moda Operandi. Her line is stocked in Selfridges. <br /> <br />

            The Lisa Folawiyo brand has shown collections on international platforms in Lagos, Johannesburg, London, Paris, Milan, and New York and has been featured in publications such as international editions of <em>Vogue, The New York Times, Harper’s Bazaar, and Elle. </em>  The brand counts with various diffusion lines, including The J Label and Pretty Precious.

          Entrepreneurship runs in the blood of Deola Sagoe, founder of Haute fashion, House of Deola.
  Her father, Chief Michael Ade-Ojo, owns the hugely successful Elizade Group now run by her brother. Her deceased mother, who started the business with the Ilara-Mokin, Ondo State High Chief, also grew a small tailoring business into a significant fashion label, producing predominantly traditional embroidered menswear. <br /> <br />
  Ahead of joining the family business like she was expected, Deola studied Business Administration at the University of Miami in Florida. After graduating in 1987, she returned to Nigeria to begin her Master's degree in Finance. Her father encouraged her to join the family business on completion of her studies.
  But rather than join the automobile conglomerate, she opted to join her mother's business and make her traditional designs more contemporary for the new marketplace. <br /> <br />
  Her fashion design credentials took a huge leap forward when she won the M/NET Anglo Gold African Designs Award, nominated by the influential US Vogue Editor, Andre Leon Tally. She was also selected as one of four designers from Africa to show their work at New York Fashion Week in 2000. <br /> <br />
  Her decision to showcase designs using authentic African fabrics from antiquity but incorporated into contemporary designs got her noticed. It became the launchpad for her haute couture business to gain global recognition. <br /> <br />
  Her fashion collections have since been modelled around the world at some of the biggest and most prestigious events.
  The globally appealing style of the mother of three has earned her an enviable clientèle that ranges from Africa's first ladies to society girls like Lydia Hearst, top model Alek Wek, and famous personalities such as Oprah Winfrey and Will Smith. <br /> <br />
   
  She frequently exhibits her couture collection at Cape Town Fashion Week. She has been a guest at the New York Fashion Week in the past. <br /> <br />
  Deola has her glamorous flagship store and headquarters on Victoria Island, Lagos. It was completed in 2008 and houses the brand's offices, production facilities and showrooms. She continues to put the Nigerian fashion scene on the global map.

                Folashade Thomas-Fahm is among the names being celebrated by London's Victoria and Albert (V&A) Museum. Next year, its Africa Fashion exhibition will commemorate past and contemporary African designers, including Mali's Chris Seydou and Ghana's Kofi Ansah. <br /> <br />
 
                Often described as the country's first modern designer, Thomas-Fahm is a former president of the Fashion Designers Association of Nigeria. She received a Lifetime Achievement Award at Arise Magazine's Fashion Week in Lagos in 2011. <br /> <br />
                
                But an illustrious career in fashion wasn't on the cards when she first moved from Lagos to London in 1953. Initially planning to train as a nurse, she changed her mind after seeing shop window displays as she walked around the city. <br /> <br />
                
                After studying fashion in London, Thomas-Fahm returned to Nigeria and opened a factory and boutique under Maison Shade (later Shade's Boutique), which became a go-to place for those searching for contemporary fashions. <br /> <br />

                In the 1960s, she became known for using traditional Nigerian textiles. Her foray into the fashion world took place in tandem with independence movements across the continent.  <br /> <br />

                Steering the V&A exhibition is the museum's curator of African and African Diaspora Fashion, Christine Checinska. For the past year, she's been speaking to icons of the industry, including Thomas-Fahm. <br /> <br />

                Checinska said Thomas-Fahm's re-evaluation of indigenous textiles and silhouettes chimed with the coming of independence for many African nations and women, symbolizing an affirmation of African identities. <br /> <br />

                "That moment of independence and liberation constituted this moment of pride in being African, pride in being Black," said Checinska. "There was a real galvanization of creativity around the arts, but in particular within fashion. You had wonderful designers like Shade Thomas-Fahm bubbling up during those years," she added. <br /> <br />

                "We want to give a platform for iconic designers like Shade Thomas-Fahm. It is important to play a part in ensuring that her contribution to global fashion history is recognized." <br /> <br />

                Checinska also notes the importance of celebrating the diversity of fashions across the continent. She said that all too often, representations of Africa focus on what's lacking. "We want our starting point to be about abundance and diversity."

                Ize grew up in Austria and studied fashion and design at the University of Applied Arts Vienna.

                Working from his studio in the Lagos suburb of Sabo Yaba, Ize collaborates with artists and design groups across Nigeria in Kwara, Kogi, and Lagos and supports a small community of weavers local to Lagos. Ize is also influencing the creative arts curriculum in local schools to create traditional fashion. <br /> <br />

                “We’re reviving, reinterpreting, and giving new context to artisan techniques that have given meaning to West African identity,” Ize told The New York Times in May 2019. <br /><br />

                In 2019, the brand introduced womenswear and currently counts Ssense, Browns, and Machine-A among its stockists. Ize was a finalist for the LVMH Prize 2019 and a joint winner of the Arise Fashion Week Award for “Designer of the Year.” <br />

                Twenty emerging, mid-career Nigerian fashion designers have been selected to participate in the International Visitors Leadership Program (IVLP), the premier professional exchange program of the U.S. Department of State.   <br />  <br /> 
                
                The virtual IVLP project titled, “Promoting Economic Growth and Trade in the Fashion Industry,” will offer a professional and cultural exchange opportunity on topics including current trends and successful business practices in the U.S. fashion industry and the practicalities of marketing and promoting African designs in the United States.  <br />  <br /> 
                
                U.S. Consulate Public Affairs Officer Stephen Ibelli explained that the IVLP project seeks to promote economic growth and trade in the fashion industry by empowering local fashion designers to not only thrive in Nigeria’s fashion industry but also to prepare for the global fashion marketplace.  <br />  <br /> 
                
                “With growing artistic, sports, film, and music ties between Nigeria and the United States, the goal of this IVLP project is to further deepen Nigerian and American ties by adding fashion as another area of growing connectivity between our two countries,” Ibelli noted. <br />  <br /> 
                
                “We are excited to provide fashion designers from Nigeria with this unique opportunity to connect with their U.S. counterparts. This is part of our strategic outreach to Nigeria’s creative industry, by strengthening economic ties through culture and fashion.”   <br />  <br /> 
                
                The IVLP project ran from August 9 to 28. Over the course of the three-week program, participants gained valuable insights from engaging with U.S. fashion designers, manufacturers, and consumers.  In addition, participants explored and enriched their knowledge of entrepreneurship, business development, and innovation in the U.S. fashion industry.  <br />  <br /> 
                
                The goal of the IVLP is to provide firsthand knowledge about U.S. society, culture, and politics while cultivating lasting professional relationships. By introducing current and emerging leaders to their professional counterparts in U.S. communities, the IVLP creates opportunities for business, professional, and academic collaboration, and offers direct exposure to American systems and values. <br />  <br />

                Fashion tech business, Catwalk Creatives Limited, a sister company of Lassod Consulting, has launched Oyoyo, a game-changing app to revolutionize the Nigerian fashion industry. <br /> <br />
                The Oyoyo app will connect designers, tailors, and weavers in Nigeria with a nationwide customer base.
                The technologically advanced app is a digital ecosystem and marketplace that allows artisan tailors, weavers, and fashion designers to create online profiles enabling them to connect with customers nationwide and worldwide. <br /> <br />
                Each profile has the ability for the designer to create seasonal or style-driven “look books” and promote their specialisms and skills and advertise their signature designs. <br /> <br />
                Building on the heritage of the Nigerian fashion and traditional textile industry, the app uses technology to harness the history of garments designed and manufactured by individual fashion designers and weavers and cataloging them in an accessible format.  <br /> <br />
                The app enhances the traditional tailoring operating model by opening up the market, removing barriers to growth, building a robust online presence, and expanding its commercial opportunities.
                One unique benefit of Oyoyo is the intuitive “measurement management” feature that allows fashion designers to take, store, and convert individual measurements into the desired format.  <br /> <br />
                Clients, or the “Oyoyo fashionistas” as the app terms them, can search, like, comment, and follow individual artisans and designers as well as connect with them and access their services. <br /> <br />
                Executive Chair, Lanre Sanni, commented, “This is an exciting time for Catwalk Creatives and Lassod as Oyoyo is the first of our products to launch in Nigeria. I feel very proud that an idea I had a couple of years ago is now coming to fruition. Using visual technology in a very accessible way as a digital marketplace, Oyoyo will showcase local talent on both the national and international stage.”
