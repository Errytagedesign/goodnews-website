         Nigerian music sensation, Burna Boy, bagged a Grammy at the 63rd Annual Awards held in Los Angeles, California, on March 14, 2021.  <br /> <br />
 Real name Damini Ebunoluwa Ogulu, he had been nominated twice previously but won the Best Global Music Album award for his 2020 album 'Twice as Tall' this time around.  <br /> <br />
With his feat, he became the first Nigerian solo artist to win a Grammy Award.  <br /> <br />
Accepting the award virtually from Lagos and surrounded by his family and fans, Burna Boy gushed, "Yes, oh! Yes oh! Yes oh! Africa is in the house, man; Africa, we're in the house, you get me? 
"This is a big win for my generation of Africans all over the world, and this should be a lesson to every African out there: no matter where you are, no matter what you plan to do, you can achieve it, no matter where you're from because you are a king.   <br /> <br />
"Look at me now, Grammy Award-winning Burna Boy. Thank you to everyone..." 
His performance to close out the Premiere Ceremony, featuring two Twice as Tall tracks, were outstanding.  <br /> <br />
Another Nigerian, Wizkid, also known as Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun, the American entertainment star Beyonc√© and her nine-year-old daughter Blue Ivy Carter jointly won the award for Best Music Video for the song Brown Skin Girl‚Äî a collaborative track involving all three. 
Previously Grammy-nominated Nigerian musicians include King Sunny Ade for his 1984 album 'Synchro System', the first album from Nigeria to be nominated for Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording.  <br /> <br />
His nomination was followed by those of Babatunde Olatunji, Femi Kuti, Sikiru Adepoju, Wizkid, Kah-Lo, Seun Kuti, Burna Boy and Tiwa Savage.  <br /> <br />
But the first Nigerian to win a Grammy award was Babatunde Olatunji for his contribution to the 1991 'Planet Drum' album by Mickey Hart, an American percussionist and musicologist.  <br /> <br />
 
Burna Boy first rose to fame in 2012 with 'Like to Party', a single from his debut album 'L.I.F.E' 
In 2017 he signed with the Atlantic Records-United States and Warner Music Group international. In 2018 he released his third studio and first major-label album, an afro-pop titled Outside.  <br /> <br />
African Giant, Burna Boy's fourth studio album, was released in 2019. It won the Album of the Year at the All-Africa Music Awards in 2019 and the BET award for Best International Act in 2020.
African Giant also brought Burna Boy his first Best World Music Album Grammy nomination at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020.  <br /> <br />

the Never.'</em> <br /> <br />
When asked why she recorded "Through the Never", the <em>"Beautiful"</em> crooner said, <em> "I recorded this Metallica song because I was quite drawn to the spirit in the song. To me, "Through the Never" questions and explores the highs and lows, the strengths and weaknesses of our humanity in the most concise of ways. I feel like it also explores our relationship with the universe and with the world around us. And there's one thing I particularly appreciate, it kind of salutes our bravery." </em> <br /> <br />
 
The Metallica Blacklist and the 30th anniversary remaster of the original Black Album will both be released on September 10. The Metallica Blacklist will feature 53 artists who have performed covers of tracks from The Black Album. <br /> <br />
