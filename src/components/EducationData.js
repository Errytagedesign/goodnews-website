           Not many people bag doctorate degrees at age 71, but Ifeyinwa Felicia Marinze did recently. 
On Thursday, July 8, 2021, Marinze was formally awarded her Ph.D. in French/Linguistics in the Faculty of Arts at the 51st convocation of the University of Lagos (UNILAG)
With that feat, the native of Ukpor, Nnewi South Local Government, Anambra State, born on March 6, 1950, became the oldest Ph.D. graduate in the Nigerian university system. <br /> <br />

Her thesis was on “Evaluation de la Competence Communicative Orale du Francais Des Apprenants Nationale Diploma Des Polytechniques Seledionness du Nigeria.” <br /> <br />
 
Commenting on her exploit at such an advanced age, Marinze said
she never thought of her age when she enrolled in the doctoral programme. <br /> <br />
 
"I told myself it was going to be a retirement project. There was this nagging problem in teaching my students all through my career as a French teacher. The students could not go beyond five sentences when engaged in oral communication in French. How can one not communicate well at the end of a two-year programme? <br /> <br />
 
"What should a language teacher do, among other variables, to help them to surmount the challenge and achieve the ability to communicate with the Language? These were my focal points. I didn't want my brain to become static because once the brain is no longer tasked, the whole body will start giving way. I was not ready to be certified brain dead. I still want to contribute to knowledge and add value to society."
The septuagenarian's first degree was at the University of Ibadan, French/English in Education, in 1980. She proceeded to acquire a master's in Curriculum Studies at UNILAG in 1985. She had another master's in French in UNILAG. She enrolled for M.Phil in 2011. She bagged a PhD from the Department of European Languages and International Studies, with matriculation number 849003042. <br /> <br />
It took Marinze 41 years after her first degree and 36 years after her first master's degree to bag the PhD.
 "God gave me patience, humility, determination and perseverance. I was a chief lecturer and director of UNEVOC Network, Yaba College of Technology, a platform for exchange, co-operation and mutual assistance."
     Her feat is more remarkable as she saw herself through the programme. "I took it as my responsibility.  <br /> <br />All the trips I made to the states and field works used for the research were my personal cash. The expenses I incurred were basically from my purse. It was truly challenging, considering the security issues too. I was focused and God Almighty protected me all through the journeys and endeavours." <br /> <br />
 Continuing about her experience, she disclosed that "The whole M.Phil/Ph.D took nine years. I am grateful to my first and second supervisors, Prof Osas Simire and Professor A. Ilupeju, for a job well done. Their support and advice gave me the strength I needed to push through. <br /> <br />
The septuagenarian urged youths to dare to dream. "Place it before God and go after it. Don't look at your age. It is only a number and a distraction. Relax your mind, eat well and have some fun too. But most importantly, do not forget your Maker, God Almighty,"
she said. <br /> <br />

           Nigerian-born serial entrepreneur Yekemi Otaru recently achieved the rare feat of being appointed Chancellor of a European university.  <br /> <br />

           In 1984, Sarki Abba Abdulkadir, currently professor of Urology and Pathology at Northwestern University, hit the limelight.  <br /> <br />
The Kano indigene had just finished from Science Secondary School, Dawakin Tofa, and scored nine distinctions (8 A1 and 1 A2) in the West African Senior School Certificate (WASC) Exams.   <br /> <br />
 
This achievement appeared unrealistic, and because it had never happened before, the West African Examination Council assumed the young schoolboy must have cheated.  <br /> <br />
 
To ascertain the actual situation, the examination body made him resit the papers in three days.   <br /> <br />
 
After reassessing the scripts, Sarki still scored nine A1s. He previously scored 'A2' in English Language but scored A1 when he retook the examination. His brilliance made WAEC institute a National Merit Award, with Sarki the first recipient.  <br /> <br />
 
Some six years later, in the 1989/90 session at Ahmadu Bello University, Sarki Abba repeated the feat. He graduated as the Overall Best Medical Student and Overall Best Graduating student of the university-aged 21.
<br /> <br />
 Sarki Abba is presently a Professor of Urology and Pathology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, USA. He is also MD, Ph.D., at the John T. Grayhack Professor of Urological Research. 
 <br /> <br />
Professor Sarki Abba's research program focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive cancer initiation, progression, and recurrence with the ultimate goal of developing therapies that interfere with these processes.  <br /> <br />
