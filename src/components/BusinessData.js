           China and GAC Motors recently demonstrated their commitment to developing Nigeria’s automobile industry when the Chinese Embassy in Nigeria and GAC held a diplomatic fleet delivery ceremony in Abuja. <br /> <br />
            The ceremony was witnessed by Mr. Cui Jianchun, Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria; Mr. Guo Zhiqiang, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy; Mr. Jubril Arogundade, General Manager, Commercial and Head of Communication of GAC Motor Nigeria, as well as Mr. Qian Jin, Business Director of GAC Motor Nigeria. <br /> <br />
            The delivery is the result of a long-lasting relationship between GAC Motors Nigeria and the Lagos State Government.  <br /> <br />
            Earlier on March 4, GAC Motors Nigeria entered a successful joint venture with the Lagos State Government, where Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu signed an agreement to assemble and produce GAC vehicles in a state of the art assembly plant in Lagos, marking the next step of the GAC Motor brand’s local operation and effort to impact positively in the life of Nigerians.
            Mr. Jianchun, the Chinese ambassador to Nigeria, expressed the support of China in developing the Nigerian automobile industry and also its involvement in the growth of GAC Motor Nigeria. <br /> <br />
            He said, “Without industry, you cannot get rich, you cannot get young people to work in this country, so what I mean here is that today is a good testament that the Chinese embassy, including myself, support the industry, the motor industry in Nigeria in the form of GAC Motors Nigeria. I believe that in the future, if we get the confidence and get the support from the young Nigerian people, that GAC Motor Nigeria could send more young Nigerians to go to China to learn not only about Chinese culture but, most importantly, about skills. In my strategy, I think Industry, Technology, and also Talent are very important for the development of Nigeria.
            “I also want to take this opportunity to mention that GAC Motor not only represents a Chinese brand, I do believe this is also a good opportunity to let young Nigerians represent a local brand like GAC Motor Nigeria.” <br /> <br />
            The diplomatic delivery of the GAC Nigeria vehicles to the Chinese Embassy underlines the strength and cooperation between both nations, bringing the know-how and technology to a new level and marking the beginning of further Industrialization; while creating jobs and improving the living standards through independent manufacturing, in order to achieve sustainable socio-economic development in Nigeria.

        contents: [`In a move that would further boost local manufacturing and grow the economy, Mikano International, in collaboration         with        leading automobile maker Geely, has established an assembly plant in Nigeria.`, <br />, <br />,
  
                  `The Mikano Geely Motor Assembly Plant in Karameh City, Warewa, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Ogun State, will produce 400,000 cars annually, has an investment portfolio of N500 billion, and create thousands of jobs.`, <br />, <br />,
  
                  `The modern factory will help meet the requirements and demands for a current car, producing 10,000 units of vehicles annually.`,  <br />, <br />, 
                  
                  `Geely owns Volvo Car Group and is the biggest shareholder of Daimler AG (to which Mercedes Benz belongs). This allows it to acquire the highest global and future technologies in the automotive industry. `,  <br />, <br />,
                  `Over the past 10 years, Geely has invested more than $14 billion in research and development (R&D) and plans to invest more in the next five years, in a commitment to providing the highest level of modern technologies in the industry and has recorded notable growth indexes.`, <br />, <br />,
  
                  `Explaining Mikano’s decision to venture into the automobile and its choice of Geely, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Mikano International, Lokman Jouni, said it was in its interest and the common good.` , <br />, <br />,
  
                  `He said: “We have almost 2,800 staff, we have eight branches across Nigeria. We have over 400 service cars. Just imagine the number of our people – our staff on the road and the number of hours they spend on the road. Number one, the quality of cars we have here, especially second-hand vehicles, is not encouraging. Also, we tried some other brand-new cars, and it was equally disappointing. Again, out of over 1.4 million cars in the market, at least 1.2m is second-hand. Nigeria has become a dumping area for the whole world.”`, <br />, <br />,
  
                  `Jouni added:  “We went to different auto shows in Beijing, Dubai, Europe. We visited other car manufacturers, and we found out that Geely can match these components. For safety purposes, Geely owns 100 per cent of the Volvo Group. So, the technology and the durability have been transferred to Geely. Then you need a car that is beautiful and elegant for people. Geely owns 10 per cent of Daimler AG – the owner of Mercedes-Benz. So, we have elegance. It is not fancy, it is beautiful, it is acceptable, it is smooth. Then we went for the strongest engine – proton. Proton is one of the highest efficient engines in the world. If you combine all these, you get a good, durable, smooth, solid car. Above all, this car was imported into Nigeria during the pandemic by air. We did well over 30,000km from Lagos to Calabar, Lagos-Kano, and other parts of the country.`, <br />, <br />,
  
                  `“We tested the car and found out it is good for Nigeria, and that was why we brought it. The car fits the Nigerian and African environment in terms of weather and fuel quality. So, in terms of height, air condition, technology, and price, it meets all requirements. It is not very cheap and at the same time not too expensive.” `
