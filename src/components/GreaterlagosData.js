      The Lagos State Government has announced the setting up of a business hub and e-commerce digital platform as part of the initiatives to enhance the growth of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and showcase their products. <br /> <br />
 
 This is as the state government has reiterated its commitment to the growth and development of the MSMEs to ensure their survival beyond the global pandemic period due to their important role in economic recovery. <br /> <br />
 `The Commissioner for Commerce, Industry, and Cooperatives, Mrs. Lola Akande, said at the 2021 Ministerial Press Briefing organized as part of the activities to mark the second anniversary of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu led administration, that some of these initiatives included the Eko MSMEs Fashion Hub 1, which was established in collaboration with the Federal Government to boost the fashion and apparel industry, the e-Commerce digital platform created to showcase MSMEs products and services to the world and the establishment of Lagos State Export Promotion Committee to promote the marketability of locally made products. <br /> <br />
  
 Others include the Lagos Council on MSMEs, a broad-based platform comprising state and Federal Government agencies for the harmonization of a state-wide dispensation of national and local MSME promotion, policies, measures, and programmes and the National Awareness and Sensitisation Tour held to promote the Africa Continental Free Trade Area Agreement; the commemoration of the African Industrialisation Day/Young African Industrialists Week during which business clinics were held to deepen the knowledge of MSMEs. <br /> <br />
  
 The Commissioner also gave assurance that the government would continue to provide strong platforms such as the organization of MSMEs Exclusive Fair to support Entrepreneurs to get the required linkage that would facilitate business development as well as trade promotion in line with the fourth pillar of the T.H.E.M.E.S Agenda, which is Making Lagos a 21st Century Economy. <br /> <br />
  
 She said: “The annual Lagos MSME Exclusive Fair is undeniable evidence of the state government’s unshaken dedication to the continuous growth of the MSME sector in the state.” <br /> <br />
  
 Akande further pointed out that the present administration would soon complete the construction of 44 factory units-Imota Light Industry Park, which is about 86 per cent done, in a bid to continue to sustain the Small Scale Industrial Estates at Mushin and Isolo as well as the industrial shed at Sabo in Ikorodu, while plans are ongoing to develop a new Small Scale Industrial Estate at Gberigbe, Ikorodu. <br /> <br />
  
 The Commissioner maintained that the government remains committed to providing a conducive environment for the Organised Private Sector and other stakeholders through continuous engagement in the implementation of policies, regulations, and projects as they impact the business prosperity of the state. <br /> <br />
  
 The annual fair is set out to support MSME operators in the state to find a way out of the challenges militating against the growth and development of the sector. <br /> <br />
 
 It featured over 100 indigenous MSMEs, who displayed their quality goods and services, ranging from food and beverages, textiles and garment, arts and beads, foods and agro-products, shoes and leather works, health and herbal products, soap, insecticide, and detergents, etc. which attracted impressive patronage of the public. <br /> <br />
 The Ministry organized Institutional Business Clinic Support Services for MSME operators during the Trade Fair and Exhibition where Federal and state regulatory and business support agencies were enlightened and, in turn, shed light on activities and services available to support MSME operators in the state. <br /> <br />

          <strong> Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu has announced that the Lekki deep seaport would commence commercial operations in 2023. </strong>   <br /> <br />
 While on a working tour of the three free trade zones in the Ibeju Lekki area of the state, the Governor said that the deep seaport and other investments in the corridor have the potential to increase the state’s GDP in multiple folds.  <br /> <br />
 “Given the report I got and what I have seen here, I can say that Lagos Free Zone has made tremendous improvement. We have seen the level of partnership Tolaram Group is bringing in terms of international investment and local brands on this corridor”, he said.  <br /> <br />
 “I commend all stakeholders that are with us on this journey we have found ourselves. With the level of work we have seen, I’m truly excited. It is more gratifying that we are taking up this assignment with all energies required and we all can see what we can achieve when we work together.  <br /> <br />
 “Since we signed a loan agreement less than 18 months ago, we have demonstrated strong capability in bringing the project to reality.”
 According to the Governor, the first phase of the seaport project, which is being financed by US$629 million facilities from China Development Bank, is at 48 per cent completion.  <br /> <br />
 The port, which is being constructed by China Harbour Engineering Company Limited, occupies 90 hectares out of the entire 830 hectares of land reserved for the Lagos Free Zone.  <br /> <br />
 Sanwo-Olu explained that the size of the deep seaport will allow 18,000 20-foot equivalent unit (TEU) capacity vessels, which are four times bigger than the ones berthing at Apapa seaports, thereby reducing the cost of container transportation from any part of the world.
 He added that the Lekki deep seaport is expected to generate more than 170,000 direct and indirect job opportunities for Lagos residents.

           Wife of Lagos State Governor, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu has presented three utility vehicles to critical agencies of government as part of efforts to ramp up their capacities to adequately fight the menace of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) in the state. <br /> <br />
 The affected agencies are the Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team (DSVRT) of the Lagos State Ministry of Justice, the Child Protection Unit of the Ministry of Youth and Social Development, and the Gender Unit of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID), Panti, Lagos. <br /> <br />
 Speaking at the event held at Lagos House, Alausa, Ikeja, Dr. Sanwo-Olu, who is coordinating the state’s multi-sectoral stakeholders’ committee against SGBV, said the donation commemorates the reward of several months of brainstorming and collaborative action among various agencies. <br /> <br />
 According to her: “In the course of our numerous meetings, we realized that some critical Stakeholders amongst us require additional utility vehicles to scale up awareness and as well galvanize action to combat the menace of violence against our women and children in the state. <br /> <br />
“We reached out to well-meaning individuals, corporate organizations, and government establishments for support and it was at this point that the Lagos State Lotteries Board graciously honored our request and supported us with these three utility vehicles,” she said. <br /> <br />
 While assuring that other agencies would equally be supported, the First Lady urged the beneficiaries to put the vehicles to good use to frontally combat all forms of SGBV in their various capacities, especially rape, defilement, among others. <br /> <br />
 She also appealed to well-meaning Nigerians, Civil Society groups, Corporate Organizations, and government at all levels to support the cause to significantly minimize the menace of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence in Lagos State in particular and Nigeria as a whole. <br /> <br />
 Responding, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Justice, Ms. Titilayo Shitta-Bay commended the First Lady for the gesture, saying that the vehicles would greatly give the needed impetus to the fight against SGBV, especially in reaching all nooks and crannies of the state. <br /> <br />
 On his part, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Youth and Social Development, Dr. Aina Olugbemiga Ayoola, said the donation would go a long way to investigate cases of child abuse and promptly rescue victims to protective custody, pending the outcome of the investigation to prevent stigmatization. <br /> <br />
 For the Deputy Commissioner of Police in Charge of State CID, Panti, Adegoke Fayoade, the First Lady deserved to be deeply commended for her passion and commitment to the fight against SGBV, adding that the vehicle would be judiciously utilized to improve service delivery and ensure justice is not only done but transparently served. <br /> <br />
 Also speaking, Chief Executive Officer of Lagos State Gaming and Lotteries Authority, Mr. Bashir Are said the donation of the vehicles was in furtherance of the vision of the agency to support good causes to make the state safe and comfortable place for all residents. <br /> <br />
 “Part of the reason why we are established is to take care of good causes in the society and domestic and gender-based violence is something that we should not take lightly. This is why we have decided to support this cause so that there will be logistics to manage, to trace, and to find a resolution to these vices in our society”, he said.

           Lagos State Government has said the “Snacks for Thought School Feeding,” programme for primary pupils in the state will cost N11 billion for the implementation, scheduled to commence in September 2021. <br /> <br />
 Special Adviser Office of Civic Engagement, Princess Aderemi Adebowale disclosed this during the 2021 Ministerial press briefing to mark the second anniversary of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu-led administration in the state, held in Alausa, Ikeja. The snacks-for-thought deals with children’s physical and cognitive development by focusing on enhancing their learning experience, which primarily starts with the child's mental disposition. <br /> <br />
 The Snacks for Thought School Feeding, Adebowale said, is a programme by the state government to complement the Home-Grown School Feeding Programme of the Federal Government that covers only pupils in primary 1-3, while the Snacks for Thought feeding is expected to take care of the pupils at the crèche and primary 4 to 6 level to ensure that all pupils partake in the school feeding programme in Lagos State when the programme is eventually adopted by the State Government. “This school feeding programme also has the tendency to serve as the socio-economic blueprint of government and in the long run prevent this generation from bequeathing a sustainable development legacy to the next generation as it does this by keeping students in school. <br /> <br />
 “When children stay in school and learn, they not only take charge of their own learning experience but also stand a greater chance of making something out of their lives while also becoming productive citizens capable of contributing to the development of the State as their formative years have been positively ensured. <br /> <br />
 “There are additional dimensions to the project other than just snacks giving such as food and nutritional security, safety and human development”, she said. <br /> <br />
 The state government, she added, is partnering with the private sector.
“We already have volunteers that would work with us, over 400 volunteers are to partake. That is why we are appealing for more Public-Private Partnerships, PPP with the government for effective implementation of the programme. <br /> <br />
 “The outbreak and effects of the Covid-19 in the state stalled the continuation of the feeding programme. <br /> <br />
 “The pilot scheme held in Lagos-Island Area covered 33 public primary schools with a total of 11,965 pupils participating in the one-week pilot school feeding exercise. The exercise is billed to recommence in September this year”, she disclosed. <br /> <br />
 Adebowale explained that Multiple Indices Indicators published by UNICEF in 2018, showed an estimated 229, 264 pupils out of school in Lagos State. <br /> <br />
 “In order to curb these rising numbers, we need more than statutory allocations. Interventions such as these will not only increase the rate of enrolment but will impact positively on gender parity and equality while also serving as a preventive security measure in reducing crime and hooliganism that may, later on, disrupt the socio-economic life of the State”, she said. <br /> <br />
 “It is also a preparedness preventive security programme that is far more than snacks-giving. It is an investment of the administration of Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu in the common future and stability of Lagos State and an important step in building a thriving 21st century Lagos, where her citizens are not only safe but productive and also understand their Civic Rights and Responsibilities. She added, “The Sanwo-Olu administration, in order to accelerate our children access to world-class educational learning, has aggressively embarked on the provision of blocks of classrooms, administrative offices, school furniture, modern toilet facilities, security in our schools and has continued to build teachers capacity with a high level of motivation for the teachers. <br /> <br />
 “These activities are to complement the womb to school initiative and ensure the public learn another conducive environment”, she further said.
