    `"I thought that the Nigerian team played very physically, did a great job in that regard and knocked down a lot of 3s," US coach Gregg Popovich said. "Give them credit."` , <br />, <br />,
    `Gabe Nnamdi Vincent, who plays for the Miami Heat, led Nigeria with 21 points. Caleb Agada scored 17 points, Ike Nwamu added 13, and Nigeria outscored the US 60-30 from the 3-point range.` , <br />, <br />,
    
    `Kevin Durant, who had never played in a USA Basketball loss in 39 senior international games, had 17 points. Jayson Tatum added 15, Damian Lillard had 14, and Bam Adebayo 11.
    "Just goes to show that we have to play better," Tatum said.` , <br />, <br />,
    
    `The Americans had gone 39-0 in their last three Olympic seasons — including pre-Olympic exhibitions — on their way to gold medals and had been 54-2 in major exhibitions since NBA players began playing for USA Basketball in 1992. `, <br />, <br />,

    `Ike Iroegbu — a former Washington State player who spent some time in the G League — hit a 3-pointer with about 1:15 left to put Nigeria up 88-80. Durant scored the next seven points for the US; a 3-pointer, two free throws following a turnover, then two more from the line with 16.5 seconds remaining.` , <br />, <br />,
    
    `Nnamdi made two foul shots with 13.2 seconds left to restore Nigeria's 3-point edge. The Americans ran 9.7 seconds off the clock on the ensuing possession without getting a shot off. Zach LaVine missed a pair of free throws — the second intentionally — with 3.5 seconds left.
    Precious Achiuwa got the rebound for Nigeria, and that was it. It's only an exhibition — but the upset was still of the massive variety, the 22nd-ranked nation by FIBA beating the No. 1-ranked team and three-time reigning Olympic gold medalists.` , <br />, <br />,

            Two siblings of Nigerian parentage, Caleb and Carney Chukwuemeka, are currently setting premier league club Aston Villa alight. <br /> <br />
            
            Younger brother, Carney, was the first on the club's books before Caleb joined him in August. The highly-rated Carney is an England under-17 midfielder, and Aston Villa was keen to reunite the pair. <br /> <br />
            The club fended interest from Norwich and Belgian side Club Brugges for the speedy 6ft 3in Chukwuemeka.
            "Aston Villa is pleased to announce the signing of Caleb Chukwuemeka," the club's announcement began. <br /> <br />
            "Caleb joins younger brother Carney in Villa's ranks after completing a move from Northampton Town for an undisclosed fee. <br /> <br />
            "The 19-year-old enjoyed a breakthrough season for the Cobblers during 2020/21, making 28 appearances across all competitions." <br /> <br />
            Academy manager Mark Harrison said: "We are delighted that Caleb has joined us. He has been a player we have been monitoring for a while now and has continued to develop well at Northampton, making some appearances last season. <br /> <br />
            "He is an exciting attacking player with an eye for goal, and we feel he has a lot of potentials. We are looking forward to working with him. <br /> <br />
            "I would like to thank Northampton for how they've handled this transfer." <br /> <br />

        <strong> On Saturday, July 24, 2021, Uche Eke made history as the first gymnast to compete for Nigeria at the Olympics. <br />  <br />
        
        Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, is blessed with many sportspeople but</strong> had never qualified a gymnast to the Olympics before.

        <br />  <br />
        In May, Eke made history when he became the first to do so -- and then competed in his first Olympic Games.

        <br />  <br />
        Eke, 23, was raised in the US, but he's been traveling to Nigeria every year since he was three to visit his father's village. Inspired by the sense of community he felt during his visits, he knew he wanted to give back -- the only question was how.

        <br />  <br />
        Like many kids, Eke grew up doing flips on the trampoline in his babysitter's backyard. Still, he wouldn't stop when trampoline time was over. He started doing backflips off his couch, landing on his head each time, until his mom decided to put him in a gymnastics class. Eke excelled and was eventually recruited to the University of Michigan, one of the top collegiate programs for men's gymnastics.

        <br />  <br />
        When Eke arrived at Michigan, he told his head coach, Kurt Golder, that he wanted to compete in the Olympics. Since Eke has dual citizenship, Golder suggested that he represent Nigeria in what would become a historic moment for the country. 

        <br />  <br />
       <strong> Eke's first major international competition for Nigeria was at the 2019 African Games in Morocco, where he emerged the best.</strong>

        <br />  <br />
        <strong> Recalling how that went, he said:</strong> "When we got there, I knew what my goal was, which was to win a gold medal for Nigeria because it hasn't been done before. And I went in there, treated it like a regular competition, try to avoid all pressures, and just went out there and had fun. And I came out first place on pommel horse.

        <br />  <br />
        "When I was on the ground right after I landed, I looked up at the score, and I saw my name on top, and I was just so happy.  <br />  <br />
        
        Even those who weren't there for Nigeria, the whole crowd was (excited), because that hasn't been done before. I just felt all the excitement and love from everyone there."  <br />  <br />

      title: "Flashback: Day Nigeria won Africa's first soccer gold",

      Description: "On August 4, 1996, Nigeria became the first African nation to win a major international soccer competition. The country came from behind twice to defeat Argentina, 3-2, on a goal in the second-to-last minute to claim the Olympic men's soccer gold medal...  ",

          On August 4, 1996, Nigeria became the first African nation to win a major international soccer competition. The country came from behind twice to defeat Argentina, 3-2, on a goal in the second-to-last minute to claim the Olympic men's soccer gold medal. <br /> <br />
          It was Nigeria's second comeback victory in as many matches against a South American soccer power. In the semifinals, the country upset gold medal favourite Brazil, 4-3, in overtime after trailing, 3-1, in the second half. <br /> <br />
          Nigeria won the final as they had throughout the competition -- with an exciting, fast-paced attacking style that appealed to American crowds, which turned out in tremendous numbers for the tournament. <br /> <br />
          A sellout of 86,116 saw the game at the University of Georgia's Sanford Stadium. <br /> <br />
          "This is not only important for Nigerian football, but for all of football as well," Nigeria Coach Jo Bonfrere said.  <br /> <br />
          "Attacking football brings the best results, and it's also a great spectacle for the fans." <br /> <br />
          Midfielder Emmanuel Amunike, a second-half substitute, gave Nigeria the victory by scoring in the 89th minute. The goal came off a free-kick and a mistake by the Argentine defence that left Amunike all alone to shoot from 12 yards as the Argentines appealed to referee Pierluigi Collina for an offside call that would have nullified the goal. <br /> <br />
          "I think it's the greatest achievement for Nigerian soccer," Amunike said. "We have been working very hard the past few years to make this possible. And it was possible today, and we are pleased about it." <br /> <br />
          "Argentina is good," Nigerian forward Nwankwo Kanu said. "Nigeria is gold." <br /> <br />
          The victory represented another step forward on the world soccer scene for Nigeria. The nation has fielded some of the sport's best youth teams in recent years. And in the 1994 World Cup -- soccer's quadrennial world championship -- Nigeria advanced to the second round before losing to eventual tournament runner-up Italy in overtime. <br /> <br />
          Several players from that team, known as the "Super Green Eagles," were chosen for the Olympic side. On Wednesday, they helped eliminate Brazil, a four-time World Cup champion seeking its first Olympic title. Amunike and Daniel Amokachi, who scored the tying goal in the 74th minute, were among Nigeria's 1994 World Cup veterans. <br /> <br />
          After their victory, the Nigerians took a victory lap around the stadium, stopping in front of fans who had played instruments, danced, and sung during the game. As they trotted around the field, the players carried a banner that read: "Thank you for your support. We love you all. Nigerian Eagles 1996." <br /> <br />

           The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) has inducted Nigerian table tennis star and former African champion Olufunke Oshonaike into the exclusive Club of seven-time Olympians known as 'Club 7'. <br /> <br />
Oshonaike was inducted into the 7th Club because of her feat as the first female table tennis player in the world and the first female athlete in Africa ever to participate in seven Olympic Games. <br /> <br />
ITTF President Thomas Weikert and former inductees attended a brief induction ceremony held in Tokyo on Monday, July 26. The former inductees were Jörgen Persson of Sweden (1988 to 2012), Zoran Primorac of Croatia and the former Yugoslavia (1988 to 2012), Belgium's Jean-Michel Saive (1988 to 2012), and Segun Toriola (1992 – 2016). <br /> <br />
Only four male table tennis players have been inducted worldwide since table tennis became an Olympic sport at the Seoul '88 Olympic Games in South Korea. Oshonaike increased the number to five, being the first female player in the world. <br /> <br />
Toriola made his Olympic debut at the Barcelona '92 Olympic Games. In contrast, Oshonaike made her Olympic Games debut at the Atlanta '96 Games in the United States. <br /> <br />
Commenting, Oshonaike expressed hope that the honor would make young Nigerians believe that dreams come true. <br /> <br />
She said, "I hope this award for me and my country, as the only female in the seventh club in the world, and the only woman in Africa to have achieved the dream of representing her country at the Olympics seven times, will brighten the hearts of Nigerians especially for young girls that dreams can come through regardless of the challenges in life." <br /> <br />
Oshonaike added:" Though I might not have won gold, silver, or bronze, I have won what no woman in the world of table tennis has ever won. Thank God for the award – the 7 Club award. I'm a proud Nigerian, and I hope more women will join me."

           10-year-old Nigerian, Tani Adewumi has become a US American Chess National Master with a rating of 2223.  <br /> <br />
 
 New York Times journalist Nicholas Kristof, who had reported Tani's earlier achievements, updated the prodigy on FaceBook.
 <br /> <br />
 He wrote "Remember Tani Adewumi, the Nigerian refugee boy I wrote about a couple of years ago when he won the NY State chess championship for his age group — while living in a homeless shelter?
 <br /> <br />
 "Readers then stepped up and helped the family get housing and helped the parents get jobs.
 <br /> <br />
 "Here's a joyful update: Tani just won another championship in Fairfield, CT, and is now (as a 10-year-old fifth-grader) a Chess National Master with a rating of 2223.
 <br /> <br />
 "In "Tightrope," we wrote that Tani exemplifies the principle that "talent is universal, but opportunity is not." <br /> <br />
 
 "He was able to soar because his homeless shelter was in a school district with a chess program, and the teacher realized that his family didn't have resources and waived the chess club fees. We need more of that!" <br /> <br />
 
 Tani and his family arrived in the US in 2017, saying they fled from Boko Haram terrorists. <br /> <br />
 
 The family obtained asylum and lived in a homeless shelter in Manhattan. During that time, the boy learned how to play chess at school.
 <br /> <br />
 The school chess coach saw the child's potential and approached his family about joining the chess program. <br /> <br />
 
 Fees were waived for Tani to join the Club. <br /> <br />
 
 The young chess player went on to win several trophies. His story in The New York Times attracted attention globally. <br /> <br />
 
 A GoFundMe page was set up to move the family out of the homeless shelter. Since its launch, the site has raised $250,000. <br /> <br />
 
 The family now has a home and has settled in New York City.
