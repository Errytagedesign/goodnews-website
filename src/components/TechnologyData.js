        26-year-old Emeka Nelson recently invented a generator that runs on water. <br /> <br />
 
 Surprised that he was able to develop such an innovation, the non-certified young man has been attracting a lot of attention following this feat, especially since he has no background in engineering. <br /> <br />
 He shared the good news on his 1kva (1000 watts) portable hydroelectric generator on Twitter. <br /> <br />
 But that’s not the latest invention by the ingenious Nelson. He has invented quite a few things too. Per the BBC, the other more popular one is a machine that converts waste into petrol and diesel. <br /> <br />
 The remarkable machine has been designed to be as portable as the hydroelectric generator. <br /> <br />
 The generator, according to Nelson, has a maximum capacity of 1000 Watts, and its voltage fluctuates between 220 and 240, he told the BBC. <br /> <br />
 In a recent story published by Legit.ng, Nelson disclosed how he had invented the machine that can transform waste to petrol, diesel as well as tiles and roofing sheets.

  <strong>  College of Education graduate builds surveillance drone </strong>
  
  
 Adebayo Kehinde, a graduate student of the College of Education-Technical, Kabba, Kogi State, has successfully built a local surveillance drone and showcased it to his lecturers and colleagues.
 Kehinde produced the drone as a project for his department. <br /> <br />
 When tested in the presence of his lecturers and colleagues, the drone flew for about three minutes (but could do six minutes). It covered about 500 metres with less noise. <br /> <br />
 Kehinde was born and raised in Kogi State.  He gained a certificate in Metals from the College of Education - Technical, Kabba. <br /> <br />
 Speaking on his skills, the young man disclosed that he had always been interested in making things. He started with building toys from childhood and, as he grew up, began making meaningful things. That was when the idea of building a drone came to his mind. <br /> <br />
 “Growing up, I built several toys like helicopters and cars, but I made up my mind to build something reasonable one day. That was when I saw a sketch of a drone in my dream, and when I woke up, I was able to bring my imagination to life”, he said. <br /> <br />
 Kehinde added that he had built four radio-controlled (RC) planes, including Fixwings, Quadcopter and Hexacopter drones that flew and landed successfully. <br /> <br />

           Agricultural bio-technologist, Dr. Abdulrazak Ibrahim, is among Nigerians flying the country’s flag on the global scene with innovative inventions. <br /> <br />
Ibrahim is the brain behind a good insect control technology developed in Brazil that has secured crop production. <br /> <br />
His RNA interference tech prevents the whitefly insect from destroying tropical crops. The invention he patented with deposits at the Brazilian Industrial Property Organization saves farmers from crop wastage and losing produce to insects. <br /> <br />
Speaking with Scicom Nigeria, Ibrahim disclosed he owes his passion for science, technology, and innovation to Professor Funso Sonaiya, a lecturer at the Obafemi Awolowo University. <br /> <br />
The academic he met in 2000 inspired him to pursue a career in biotechnology. He said he had great admiration for the way and manner in which the professor carried himself. His technical rendition also endeared him to the seasoned lecturer, and he aimed to be like him. <br /> <br />
Ibrahim holds a doctoral degree in Molecular Biology from Universidade de Brasília, Brazil, a master’s degree in Plant Biochemistry from Universidade Federal do Ceará, Brazil, and a BS in Biochemistry from Bayero University, Kano, Nigeria. <br /> <br />
 He is experienced in plant tissue culture and genetic transformation, and molecular techniques. He developed and patented the technology to control whitefly using RNA interference technology in Embrapa, Brasília, Brazil, where he spent nearly 10 years. <br /> <br />
He has taught several courses in biology, agricultural and medical biochemistry, plant science, agricultural biotechnology, nutrition, biosafety, and more at undergraduate and postgraduate levels and supervises research projects at different levels. <br /> <br />

Leading global e-commerce platform, WooCommerce has selected Nigeria’s Paystack as its preferred payment partner in Africa. <br />  <br />
 
 With the selection, Paystack has been integrated into the WooCommerce experience, and WooCommerce merchants can easily accept payments via Paystack. <br />  <br />
  
 Before the partnership, merchants and developers had to separately download the Paystack plugin and integrate it into their WooCommerce account.<br />  <br />
  
 Commenting on the development, WooCommerce’s Director of Business Development, Michael Couvaras, said Paystack is “leading” the change in bringing a world-class payment experience to African merchants. <br />  <br />
  
  “Their product offering, user experience, and expansion plans within Africa were some of the most important factors in considering the partnership. Receiving funding from Stripe and Visa was also a strong indicator of their potential.” Couvaras added.<br />  <br />
  
 Since being acquired by Stripe in October 2020. Paystack, which only had operations in Nigeria and Ghana, has expanded into the South African market. And for WooCommerce, though e-commerce is still nascent in most African countries, Nigeria and South Africa are amongst its fastest-growing countries globally. <br />  <br /> 
  
  Also speaking on the partnership, Head of Strategic Partnerships at Paystack and a renowned partnership broker, Joel Bronkowski said, “We’ve also partnered with some of our friends at 4 digital agencies Semantica, Woww, Yobo, and Gen6 to help you set up your WooCommerce store for a fee.”  <br />  <br />
 Paystack now joins its parent company, Stripe as an independent partner in WooCommerce’s payment pool. We expect this partnership to speed up its expansion plan into other African countries. <br />  <br />

      `Nigeria’s first domestically launched music streaming service, uduX, has developed a new product called PopRev in partnership with PiggyVest.` , <br />, <br />,
       
      `PopRev will allow music lovers to invest in their favorite musician’s project and make profits based on the project’s digital streaming performance. The solution will see fans become more instrumental to the financial success of their favorite artists.` , <br />, <br />,
       
      `Fans can track their investment through the uduX platform, available as both web and mobile apps. The apps will give them real-time insights into the streaming performance of the music they invested in. Fans can also invite other people to listen to the artist’s music on uduX. Whatever revenue is made from the music is shared with the concerned investors.` , <br />, <br />,
       
      `As the financial partner for the product, PiggyVest, which has a platform of over 2 million active customers, already helps its users save and invest money. With PopRev, PiggyVest and uduX are concerned with offering artists a chance to get more money to create while giving fans a chance to play a part in a musician’s success story.` , <br />, <br />,
      
      `Afrobeats artist Davido has hailed the platform as timely and needful, adding that “An initiative like PopRev will afford many creators who, for example, struggled through the lockdown, the privilege to create without concerns of funding.”` , <br />, <br />,
       
      `Chidi Okeke, uduX’s CEO, said, “It’s about sharing. Creating meaningful experiences that people can connect with and root for. The music industry has continuously failed to innovate, and this has nothing to do with a lack of technology. The problem with innovation in this space is the lack of incentives. `, <br />, <br />,
       
      `PopRev gives artists access to funding while letting them keep their masters. We’re creating a new artist revenue model driven by fans’ social engagement and the new normal of ‘sharing’. We want to give investors access to metrics and the performance of their investments on-demand. For the wider industry, we’re providing a leg-up to the untapped potential of musical talent in the African diaspora.”` , <br />, <br />,
       
      `Somto Ifezue, CEO of PiggyVest, said, “uduX is a very innovative solutions platform within the music ecosystem, and we’re thrilled to work with them. This music business solution builds equity for African artists and will be very attractive to our investors. We believe this product will help shape a new business model of revenue generation and open up the market for more data-driven investment.”` , <br />, <br />,
