      contents: [`In a move that would further boost local manufacturing and grow the economy, Mikano International, in collaboration         with        leading automobile maker Geely, has established an assembly plant in Nigeria.`, <br />, <br />,

                `The Mikano Geely Motor Assembly Plant in Karameh City, Warewa, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Ogun State, will produce 400,000 cars annually, has an investment portfolio of N500 billion, and create thousands of jobs.`, <br />, <br />,

                `The modern factory will help meet the requirements and demands for a current car, producing 10,000 units of vehicles annually.`,  <br />, <br />, 
                
                `Geely owns Volvo Car Group and is the biggest shareholder of Daimler AG (to which Mercedes Benz belongs). This allows it to acquire the highest global and future technologies in the automotive industry. `,  <br />, <br />,
                `Over the past 10 years, Geely has invested more than $14 billion in research and development (R&D) and plans to invest more in the next five years, in a commitment to providing the highest level of modern technologies in the industry and has recorded notable growth indexes.`, <br />, <br />,

                `Explaining Mikano’s decision to venture into the automobile and its choice of Geely, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Mikano International, Lokman Jouni, said it was in its interest and the common good.` , <br />, <br />,

                `He said: “We have almost 2,800 staff, we have eight branches across Nigeria. We have over 400 service cars. Just imagine the number of our people – our staff on the road and the number of hours they spend on the road. Number one, the quality of cars we have here, especially second-hand vehicles, is not encouraging. Also, we tried some other brand-new cars, and it was equally disappointing. Again, out of over 1.4 million cars in the market, at least 1.2m is second-hand. Nigeria has become a dumping area for the whole world.”`, <br />, <br />,

                `Jouni added:  “We went to different auto shows in Beijing, Dubai, Europe. We visited other car manufacturers, and we found out that Geely can match these components. For safety purposes, Geely owns 100 per cent of the Volvo Group. So, the technology and the durability have been transferred to Geely. Then you need a car that is beautiful and elegant for people. Geely owns 10 per cent of Daimler AG – the owner of Mercedes-Benz. So, we have elegance. It is not fancy, it is beautiful, it is acceptable, it is smooth. Then we went for the strongest engine – proton. Proton is one of the highest efficient engines in the world. If you combine all these, you get a good, durable, smooth, solid car. Above all, this car was imported into Nigeria during the pandemic by air. We did well over 30,000km from Lagos to Calabar, Lagos-Kano, and other parts of the country.`, <br />, <br />,

                `“We tested the car and found out it is good for Nigeria, and that was why we brought it. The car fits the Nigerian and African environment in terms of weather and fuel quality. So, in terms of height, air condition, technology, and price, it meets all requirements. It is not very cheap and at the same time not too expensive.” `

      Precious Achiuwa got the rebound for Nigeria, and that was it. It's only an exhibition — but the upset was still of the massive variety, the 22nd-ranked nation by FIBA beating the No. 1-ranked team and three-time reigning Olympic gold medalists.` , <br />, <br />,

        Entrepreneurship runs in the blood of Deola Sagoe, founder of Haute fashion, House of Deola.
Her father, Chief Michael Ade-Ojo, owns the hugely successful Elizade Group now run by her brother. Her deceased mother, who started the business with the Ilara-Mokin, Ondo State High Chief, also grew a small tailoring business into a significant fashion label, producing predominantly traditional embroidered menswear. <br /> <br />
Ahead of joining the family business like she was expected, Deola studied Business Administration at the University of Miami in Florida. After graduating in 1987, she returned to Nigeria to begin her Master's degree in Finance. Her father encouraged her to join the family business on completion of her studies.
But rather than join the automobile conglomerate, she opted to join her mother's business and make her traditional designs more contemporary for the new marketplace. <br /> <br />
Her fashion design credentials took a huge leap forward when she won the M/NET Anglo Gold African Designs Award, nominated by the influential US Vogue Editor, Andre Leon Tally. She was also selected as one of four designers from Africa to show their work at New York Fashion Week in 2000. <br /> <br />
Her decision to showcase designs using authentic African fabrics from antiquity but incorporated into contemporary designs got her noticed. It became the launchpad for her haute couture business to gain global recognition. <br /> <br />
Her fashion collections have since been modelled around the world at some of the biggest and most prestigious events.
The globally appealing style of the mother of three has earned her an enviable clientèle that ranges from Africa's first ladies to society girls like Lydia Hearst, top model Alek Wek, and famous personalities such as Oprah Winfrey and Will Smith. <br /> <br />
 
She frequently exhibits her couture collection at Cape Town Fashion Week. She has been a guest at the New York Fashion Week in the past. <br /> <br />
Deola has her glamorous flagship store and headquarters on Victoria Island, Lagos. It was completed in 2008 and houses the brand's offices, production facilities and showrooms. She continues to put the Nigerian fashion scene on the global map.
