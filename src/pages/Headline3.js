                Wife of Lagos State Governor, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu has presented three utility vehicles to
                critical agencies of government as part of efforts to ramp up their capacities to adequately fight
                the menace of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) in the state. <br /> <br />
                The affected agencies are the Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team (DSVRT) of the
                Lagos State Ministry of Justice, the Child Protection Unit of the Ministry of Youth and Social
                Development, and the Gender Unit of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence
                Department (SCIID), Panti, Lagos. <br /> <br />
                Speaking at the event held at Lagos House, Alausa, Ikeja, Dr. Sanwo-Olu, who is coordinating
                the state’s multi-sectoral stakeholders’ committee against SGBV, said the donation
                commemorates the reward of several months of brainstorming and collaborative action among
                various agencies. <br /> <br />
                According to her: “In the course of our numerous meetings, we realized that some critical
                Stakeholders amongst us require additional utility vehicles to scale up awareness and as well
                galvanize action to combat the menace of violence against our women and children in the state. <br /> <br />

                <strong> “We reached out to well-meaning individuals, corporate organizations, and government
                establishments for support and it was at this point that the Lagos State Lotteries Board
                graciously honored our request and supported us with these three utility vehicles,” </strong> she said.
                While assuring that other agencies would equally be supported, the First Lady urged the
                beneficiaries to put the vehicles to good use to frontally combat all forms of SGBV in their
                various capacities, especially rape, defilement, among others. <br /> <br />
                She also appealed to well-meaning Nigerians, Civil Society groups, Corporate Organizations,
                and government at all levels to support the cause to significantly minimize the menace of Sexual
                and Gender-Based Violence in Lagos State in particular and Nigeria as a whole. <br /> <br />
                Responding, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Justice, Ms. Titilayo Shitta-Bay commended the
                First Lady for the gesture, saying that the vehicles would greatly give the needed impetus to the
                fight against SGBV, especially in reaching all nooks and crannies of the state. <br /> <br />
                On his part, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Youth and Social Development, Dr. Aina
                Olugbemiga Ayoola, said the donation would go a long way to investigate cases of child abuse
                and promptly rescue victims to protective custody, pending the outcome of the investigation to
                prevent stigmatization. <br /> <br />
                For the Deputy Commissioner of Police in Charge of State CID, Panti, Adegoke Fayoade, the
                First Lady deserved to be deeply commended for her passion and commitment to the fight
                against SGBV, adding that the vehicle would be judiciously utilized to improve service delivery
                and ensure justice is not only done but transparently served. <br /> <br />
                Also speaking, Chief Executive Officer of Lagos State Gaming and Lotteries Authority, Mr.
                Bashir Are said the donation of the vehicles was in furtherance of the vision of the agency to
                support good causes to make the state safe and comfortable place for all residents.
                <br /> <br />
                <strong> “Part of the reason why we are established is to take care of good causes in the society and
                domestic and gender-based violence is something that we should not take lightly. This is why
                we have decided to support this cause so that there will be logistics to manage, to trace, and to
                find a resolution to these vices in our society”,</strong> he said.
