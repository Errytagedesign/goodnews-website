        Nigerian music sensation, Burna Boy, bagged a Grammy at the 63rd Annual
        Awards held in Los Angeles, California, on March 14, 2021. <br /> <br />
        Real name Damini Ebunoluwa Ogulu, he had been nominated twice previously
        but won the Best Global Music Album award for his 2020 album 'Twice as
        Tall' this time around. <br /> <br />
        With his feat, he became the first Nigerian solo artist to win a Grammy
        Award. <br /> <br />
        Accepting the award virtually from Lagos and surrounded by his family
        and fans, Burna Boy gushed, "Yes, oh! Yes oh! Yes oh! Africa is in the
        house, man; Africa, we're in the house, you get me? "This is a big win
        for my generation of Africans all over the world, and this should be a
        lesson to every African out there: no matter where you are, no matter
        what you plan to do, you can achieve it, no matter where you're from
        because you are a king. <br /> <br />
        "Look at me now, Grammy Award-winning Burna Boy. Thank you to
        everyone..." His performance to close out the Premiere Ceremony,
        featuring two Twice as Tall tracks, were outstanding. <br /> <br />
        Another Nigerian, Wizkid, also known as Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun, the
        American entertainment star Beyoncé and her nine-year-old daughter Blue
        Ivy Carter jointly won the award for Best Music Video for the song Brown
        Skin Girl— a collaborative track involving all three. Previously
        Grammy-nominated Nigerian musicians include King Sunny Ade for his 1984
        album 'Synchro System', the first album from Nigeria to be nominated for
        Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording. <br /> <br />
        His nomination was followed by those of Babatunde Olatunji, Femi Kuti,
        Sikiru Adepoju, Wizkid, Kah-Lo, Seun Kuti, Burna Boy and Tiwa Savage.{" "}
        <br /> <br />
        But the first Nigerian to win a Grammy award was Babatunde Olatunji for
        his contribution to the 1991 'Planet Drum' album by Mickey Hart, an
        American percussionist and musicologist. <br /> <br />
        Burna Boy first rose to fame in 2012 with 'Like to Party', a single from
        his debut album 'L.I.F.E' In 2017 he signed with the Atlantic
        Records-United States and Warner Music Group international. In 2018 he
        released his third studio and first major-label album, an afro-pop
        titled Outside. <br /> <br />
        African Giant, Burna Boy's fourth studio album, was released in 2019. It
        won the Album of the Year at the All-Africa Music Awards in 2019 and the
        BET award for Best International Act in 2020. African Giant also brought
        Burna Boy his first Best World Music Album Grammy nomination at the 62nd
        Annual Grammy Awards in 2020. <br /> <br />

        This is a significant win for the singers. <br /> <br />
        Billboard is an American magazine and website that produces news,
        videos, opinions, reviews, events, and styles related to the music
        industry. <br /> <br />
        It is known for its music charts, including the Hot 100, Billboard 200
        and Global 200, tracking the most popular songs and albums in different
        genres. <br /> <br />
        It also hosts events, owns a publishing firm, and operates several TV
        shows. <br /> <br />
        Billboard made the announcement and verification on their official
        Billboard Charts Instagram page @billboard, where they said “Essence”
        debuted at No. 82 on Billboard’s Hot 100 list”. According to the post,
        it is also verified that this is Tem’s first chart appearance. <br />{" "}
        <br />
        “@wizkidayo’s “Essence,” featuring @temsbaby, debuts at No. 82 on this
        week’s #Hot100. It earns Tems her first career entry on the chart,”
        Billboard said. <br /> <br />
        Wizkid’s third chart entry followed the success of “One Dance”, which
        peaked at No. 1 in 2016.

          In celebration of the upcoming 30th anniversary of their album
          'Metallica' AKA 'The Black Album, The Metallica Blacklist, a
          compilation of 53 artists each covering their favorite Black Album
          tracks, will be released September 10.
        </strong>
        Pre-orders of The Metallica Blacklist feature instant gratification
        tracks, including the Nigerian fast-rising singer Tomi Owó's newly
        available version of <em>'Through the Never.'</em> <br /> <br />
        When asked why she recorded "Through the Never", the
        <em>"Beautiful"</em> crooner said,
        <em>
          "I recorded this Metallica song because I was quite drawn to the
          spirit in the song. To me, "Through the Never" questions and explores
          the highs and lows, the strengths and weaknesses of our humanity in
          the most concise of ways. I feel like it also explores our
          relationship with the universe and with the world around us. And
          there's one thing I particularly appreciate, it kind of salutes our
          bravery."
        </em>
        <br /> <br />
        The Metallica Blacklist and the 30th anniversary remaster of the
        original Black Album will both be released on September 10. The
        Metallica Blacklist will feature 53 artists who have performed covers of
        tracks from The Black Album. <br /> <br />
        Among the featured artists are
        <strong> Tomi Owo, Juanes, Miley Cyrus, J Balvin,</strong> and
        <strong> Weezer. </strong> All of The Metallica Blacklist sales will
        benefit 52 charities. <br /> <br />
        A dynamic songwriter with a distinct vocal tone, Tomi Owó incorporates
        reality with substance to make for the musical output she is coming to
        be known for.
